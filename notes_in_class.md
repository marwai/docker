## What is Docker?
Docker is an open source platform for containerisation.



## Difference?
- Docker is lightweight compared to VMs - rather than running a whole virtual machine - the dependencies can be packaged
- OS apgnostic - doesn't matter what system you use - rather than emulating system hardware
- Docker shares the resource of an OS than creating an entire virtual environment
- Good streaming - available in local host - loses internet 
- More images
- Vagrant is slow - akes a lot of time loading
